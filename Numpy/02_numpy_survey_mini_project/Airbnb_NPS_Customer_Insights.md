**Case Study: NPS (Net Promoter Score)**

As a **Data Analyst** at **Airbnb**, the task involves analyzing user
survey data and reporting the **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** to the
manager. NPS measures **customer satisfaction** and the **likelihood of
customers** **recommending the service to others.**

**Rating Scores**

Customers are asked to rate their likelihood to recommend the service on
a scale **from 0 to 10:**

-   **0--6 →** Detractors (unlikely to recommend, possibly speaking
    > negatively)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **7--8 →** Neutrals / Passives (satisfied but not enthusiastic
    > enough to actively recommend)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **9--10 →** Promoters (loyal enthusiasts who are highly likely to
    > recommend)

**Key Points:**

-   NPS scores vary from company to company.

```{=html}

```
-   Analysis should focus on both **detractors** and **promoters** to
    > understand what is going wrong for dissatisfied customers and why
    > they are not satisfied.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Neutrals** are uncertain about recommending and do not
    > significantly impact the score but can be influenced to become
    > promoters.

**NPS Calculation Formula:**

NPS Score = % Promoters - % Detractors

-   A higher NPS indicates more promoters and fewer detractors.

-   An NPS score **greater than 70% is considered excellent** and
    > reflects very high customer satisfaction and loyalty.
