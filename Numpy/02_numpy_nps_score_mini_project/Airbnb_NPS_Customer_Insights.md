<h1 align="center">ðŸ“Š Case Study: NPS (Net Promoter Score)</h1>

As a **Data Analyst** at **Airbnb**, the task involves analyzing user
survey data and reporting the **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** to the
manager. NPS measures **customer satisfaction** and the **likelihood of
customers** **recommending the service to others.**

<h3 >ðŸ“ˆ Rating Scores</h3>

Customers are asked to rate their likelihood to recommend the service on
a scale **from 0 to 10:**

-   **0--6 â†’** Detractors (unlikely to recommend, possibly speaking
    > negatively)


-   **7--8 â†’** Neutrals / Passives (satisfied but not enthusiastic
    > enough to actively recommend)


-   **9--10 â†’** Promoters (loyal enthusiasts who are highly likely to
    > recommend)

**Key Points:**

-   NPS scores vary from company to company.


-   Analysis should focus on both **detractors** and **promoters** to
    > understand what is going wrong for dissatisfied customers and why
    > they are not satisfied.


-   **Neutrals** are uncertain about recommending and do not
    > significantly impact the score but can be influenced to become
    > promoters.

**NPS Calculation Formula:**

<p align="center"><b>NPS Score = % Promoters âˆ’ % Detractors</b></p>

-   A higher NPS indicates more promoters and fewer detractors.


-   An NPS score **greater than 70% is considered excellent** and  eflects very high customer satisfaction and loyalty.
