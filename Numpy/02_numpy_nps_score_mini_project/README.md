## 📊 Airbnb NPS Customer Insights

Hi there! This is **Komal**, and welcome to my project on **Net Promoter Score (NPS) Analysis** for Airbnb. 🏠✨

In this project, I dive into **customer survey data** to understand how satisfied Airbnb users are and how likely they are to recommend the service to others.  
The aim is to turn raw survey responses into **clear business insights** that help improve customer experience.

Here’s what you’ll find inside this project:

- 📖 **Introduction to NPS** – what it means and why it’s important
- 🏷 **Customer Categories**:
  - **Detractors** 😡 – 0 to 6 rating (unlikely to recommend)
  - **Neutrals / Passives** 😐 – 7 to 8 rating (satisfied but not enthusiastic)
  - **Promoters** 😍 – 9 to 10 rating (loyal and highly likely to recommend)
- 🔍 **Key Analysis Points**:
  - How to calculate NPS
  - Why NPS scores vary from company to company
  - How to identify problems from detractor feedback
  - Ways to turn neutrals into promoters
- 🧮 **Formula** for NPS:  
  <p align="center"><b>NPS Score = % Promoters − % Detractors</b></p>
- 🏆 **Benchmark** – An NPS score above **70%** is considered **excellent** ⭐

This project is a **hands-on example** of turning survey numbers into **actionable customer insights**.  
If you’re interested in analytics, business intelligence, or customer experience, you’ll find this case study both useful and easy to follow.

Feel free to explore the code, adapt it to your own datasets, and share your ideas! 😊
