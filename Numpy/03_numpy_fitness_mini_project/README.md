<h1>Welcome to my <b>Fitness Smartwatch Case Study!</b></h1>

 👋 Hi - I’m Komal. This project analyses smartwatch data (sleep, calories, steps, mood, activity) to surface insights, build personalized goals, and deliver recommendations that help users improve sleep quality, activity consistency, and overall wellbeing. 🚴‍♀️🛌🔥

 <h3>🔎 <b>Project Overview</b></h3>

<b>Goal</b>: Analyze wearable data to understand patterns in sleep, activity, calories burned and mood — then use those patterns to propose personalized step/activity goals, recovery notifications, and gamification features.

<b>Dataset (example columns):</b>

<b>date</b> - day of observation (YYYY-MM-DD)

<b>sleep</b> - hours of sleep

<b>calories</b> - calories burned

<b>step_count</b> - steps taken

<b>mood</b> - mood label (Happy, Neutral, Sad, etc.)

<b>activity</b> - activity label (Active, Inactive)

<h3>✨ <b>Key Features / Deliverables</b></h3>

* Correlation checks between sleep, calories and steps

* Personalized daily step & activity goals based on past performance trends 🎯

* Sleep-quality notifications + recovery tips (to boost mood & energy) 💤➡️🙂

* Time-of-day workout challenges based on peak activity patterns (morning/evening)

<h3>💡 <b> Product Recommendations (how to turn insights into features) </b>b></h3>

*  <b>Personalized goals: </b> use weekly percentiles (50th/75th) to set adaptive targets (e.g., +10% on median steps).

* <b> Sleep-quality notifications: </b> when sleep drops below personal baseline, push a gentle recovery tip (hydrate, light stretching, wind-down routine).

*  <b>Gamification: </b> award badges for 7-day streaks and micro-goals (2k steps, 5k steps) with social sharing.

*  <b>Timed challenges: </b> analyze per-hour step/activity histograms; schedule morning/evening challenges at users' natural peak times.


<h3> <b>Impact </b></h3>
This analysis not only helps users achieve their fitness goals but also provides data-driven product improvement opportunities for the smartwatch, enhancing engagement and long-term health benefits.
