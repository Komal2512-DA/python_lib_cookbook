 <h1 align='center' >ðŸ“Š <b> Case Study Summary - Fitness Data Analysis</b></h1>
As a Data Analyst for a <b>fitness technology company</b>, I conducted an exploratory analysis of smartwatch data to uncover patterns in <b>user activity, mood, calorie expenditure, and sleep.</b>

<p></p>
<p>Dataset Overview</p>
The dataset spans <b>October 2017 - January 2018</b> and includes:
<p></p>
<b>Step Count</b> - Total daily steps recorded
<p></p>

<b>Mood</b> - Self-reported emotional state (Happy, Sad, Neutral)

<b>Calories Burned</b> - Daily energy expenditure

<b>Hours of Sleep</b> - Total nightly sleep duration

<b>Active Status</b> - Whether the user was active or inactive on a given day

<h3><b>Key Insights</b></h3>
<b>Activity & Mood Correlation:</b> Higher step counts often align with happier moods, while lower activity levels correlate with sadness.
<p></p>
<b>Calorie Burn Patterns:</b> Active days significantly increase calories burned, particularly on days with >5,000 steps.
<p></p>
<b>Sleep Impact:</b> Sleep hours range from 4 to 8, but low sleep days tend to coincide with reduced activity and calories burned.
<p></p>
<b>Inactive Days:</b> The majority of the recorded days are inactive, suggesting scope for behavioral change interventions.

<h3><b>Objective</b></h3>
The goal is to identify lifestyle patterns and potential recommendations to improve user wellness through data-driven insights, which could inform smartwatch features like personalized activity goals, sleep reminders, and mood-based alerts.
