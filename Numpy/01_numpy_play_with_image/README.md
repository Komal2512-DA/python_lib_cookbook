## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Hi there! This is **Komal**, and welcome to my mini project on **Image Manipulation using Python**. ðŸ“¸

In this project, Iâ€™ve explored how to work with images using libraries like **Matplotlib** and **NumPy**. It starts with loading an image and converting it into a NumPy array, and then moves on to a series of fun and creative image transformations!

Some of the exciting operations I've implemented include:

- Understanding what **RGB** is and how it defines image color
- Changing image colors and visualizing different color channels
- Rotating and reversing images
- Creating **negative images**
- Applying **blur effects**
- Enhancing image contrast
- And much more!

This project is a hands-on experiment to understand how digital images work and how we can manipulate them through code. Whether you're a beginner or just curious about image processing, I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it!

Feel free to check out the code, try it with your own images, and even contribute! ðŸ˜Š
